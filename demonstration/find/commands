# The ../labyrinth directory contains a fiendish maze of 
# directories populated with glittering treasures and dangerous
# creatures. Let's use the find command to get a path through
# the labyrinth to the treasures within. 

# We know from ancient writings that all the treasures are
# hidden in rooms deep within the winding corridors.

find ../labyrinth -name "room"

# Okay, so we've tracked down all the rooms where treasures
# might be hidden. Unfortunately, several creatures also live
# in the maze. They like to linger around nexuses (points 
# where four paths converge). Let's work out where those 
# nexuses are.

find ../labyrinth -name "nexus"

# We had better avoid any paths to rooms that include a nexus.
# Let's identify those. How about using a wildcard expression

find ../labyrinth -name "*nexus*room"

# Hmm, that didn't work. That's because the nexuses and rooms
# occur at different points in the path. We need 

find ../labyrinth -wholename "*nexus*room"

# By using wholename we have indeed identified all the paths
# leading to a room that passes through a nexus. But what we 
# really want to know is all of the safe paths to rooms -
# those that don't pass through nexuses. 

# It is possible to do that with find, but we'll use the grep 
# instead.
