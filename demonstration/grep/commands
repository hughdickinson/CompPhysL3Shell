# At the end of the find tutorial, we saved a list of paths through
# the labyrinth that end at rooms to the file "roomsInMaze". Using
# the grep command we can search that file for all paths that pass
# through a nexus.

# NORMAL OPERATION: grep "SEARCH PATTERN" FILE
grep "nexus" roomsInMaze

# So far we've done no better than using find with wholename and a
# wildcard pattern. However, by using the -v flag we can instruct grep
# to perform an INVERSE MATCH. So to print all paths that DO NOT
# pass through a nexus we use

# INVERSE MATCH: grep -v "SEARCH PATTERN" FILE

grep -v "nexus" roomsInMaze

# Okay, let's have a look at what's in one of these safe rooms

ls ../labyrinth/turn-right/turn-left/turn-left/turn-right/room

# Ooh! A treasure chest! I wonder what's in it

cat ../labyrinth/turn-right/turn-left/turn-left/turn-right/room/treasure-chest

# Empty?! Grrrr! What we need is a list of rooms at the end of
# safe paths that contain treasure chests that aren't empty! We'll
# do this two stages. The first uses the familiar PIPE operator "|"
# to send the output of the find command directly to grep

# FIND ALL TREASURE CHESTS | ELIMINATE NEXUSES > SAVE TO FILE
find ../labyrinth -name "treasure-chest" | grep -v "nexus" > safeTreasureChests

# Now we can use the xargs command to invoke grep and search each
# of the safe treasure chests to find those that aren't empty. We'll
# use the -H flag to print the paths as well as the matching strings.

cat safeTreasureChests | xargs -i{} grep -H -v "empty" {}

# NOTE: We didn't really need to save the intermediate file. We
# could have simply piped the output of the first command to the
# second command i.e. 

find ../labyrinth -name "treasure-chest" | grep -v "nexus" | xargs -i{} grep -H -v "empty" {}

# NOTE: If we ONLY wanted the paths - NOT the chest contents - we could
# have used the "cut" command, specifying the ':' character as a
# delimiter e.g.

find ../labyrinth -name "treasure-chest" | grep -v "nexus" | xargs -i{} grep -H -v "empty" {} | cut -d":" -f 1

# All those treasures have made me avaricious! I wonder if
# there's a way to what's lurking at all those scary nexuses.
# Let's try using find to get the paths to all treasure chests in
# the maze, then using grep with a regular expression that matches
# an arbitrary-length string of arbirary characters (".*") followed
# by the word "nexus". We use the -o flag so that grep will only
# print the part of the path that matches.

find ../labyrinth -name "treasure-chest" | grep -o ".*nexus" 

# Okay, now let's use xargs tosee what's lurking at each of those
# nexuses

find ../labyrinth -name "treasure-chest" | grep -o ".*nexus" | xargs -i{} ls {}

# Hmm, creature that's not very instructive. I wonder what types of
# creatures live in the maze.

find ../labyrinth -name "creature" | xargs -i{} cat {}

# I think we can deal with a few rats! Let's try to find paths 
# to filled treasure chests, that have nexuses with "tame" rats...

Actually, that sounds like a good homework question!
